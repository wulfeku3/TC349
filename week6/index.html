    <p> The D2L site is a good example of multiple design principles we covered in class.</p>
   <br>
    <p> The first is <b>chunking</b>. The different sections--such as My Courses, News, Need Help?, My Settings, etc.--separate content into multiple logical hgroups that help navigation and keep the user from being overwhelmed by huge blocks of information.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Next is the <b>golden ratio</b>. The main section is split up with one large column (My Courses) taking up about two thirds of the page, while the other column (News, Need Help?, etc.) takes up about one third of the space.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The next principle is <b>signal to noise ratio</b>. The design is simple, pleasant to look at, and well organized. There really isn't any irrelevant information or noise on the main page that would distract the user.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Next is <b>affordance</b>. Similar to above, everything is very self-explanitory and nothing really confuses the user. The links for email, registration, etc. are clear and the icons at the top are easy to figure out how they function when clicked based on the images.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Last is <b>mapping</b>. When extended, the dropdowns for each semester contain only the classes and information for that specific semester. Under Fall 2014, all of my classes for this semester are grouped together instead of spread throughout the page, and one link leads to one designated location.

    <p>Unfortunately, D2L also has some poor examples of design principles based on how the individual course site is set up.</p>
    <br>
    <p> The <b>golden ratio</b> is no longer in effect on this page. Another big problem is <b>affordance</b>; just by looking, I don't know what the dropdown arrow next to the topic title or the arrow tab to the left of the post do without investigating further. <b>Chunking</b> could help with visual interest and clarity. The <b>signal to noise</b> ratio could be higher as well by removing page cluttering objects such as the search bar when they are unnecessary. Finally, this layout is a poor example of <b>mapping</b>, considering there are two of the exact same button right unnecessarily close to each other (Reply to Thread).
